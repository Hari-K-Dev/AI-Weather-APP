# Heat and Cold Weather Safety

## Extreme Heat

Heat is the leading weather-related killer. Your body normally cools itself by sweating, but high humidity can make this less effective.

### Heat Index Risk Levels

| Heat Index | Risk Level | Symptoms Possible |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| 80-90°F | Caution | Fatigue with prolonged exposure |
| 90-103°F | Extreme Caution | Heat cramps, heat exhaustion possible |
| 103-124°F | Danger | Heat exhaustion likely, heat stroke possible |
| 125°F+ | Extreme Danger | Heat stroke highly likely |

### Heat-Related Illnesses

**Heat Cramps**
- Symptoms: Muscle spasms, usually in legs or abdomen
- Action: Rest in cool place, drink water, gentle stretching

**Heat Exhaustion**
- Symptoms: Heavy sweating, weakness, cold/pale/clammy skin, fast weak pulse, nausea, fainting
- Action: Move to cool place, loosen clothing, apply cool wet cloths, sip water. Seek medical help if vomiting.

**Heat Stroke (Medical Emergency)**
- Symptoms: High body temperature (103°F+), hot/red/dry skin, rapid strong pulse, confusion, unconsciousness
- Action: Call 911 immediately. Cool person rapidly with cold water or ice. Do NOT give fluids.

### Heat Safety Tips

- Stay in air-conditioned spaces during peak heat (10 AM - 6 PM)
- Drink plenty of water before you feel thirsty
- Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing
- Never leave children or pets in parked vehicles
- Take cool showers or baths
- Check on elderly neighbors and relatives
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine
- Eat light meals

## Extreme Cold

Cold weather can be life-threatening, especially for elderly, very young, and those without adequate shelter.

### Wind Chill Risk Levels

| Wind Chill | Risk | Frostbite Time |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 0 to -10°F | Increased risk | 30 minutes |
| -10 to -25°F | High risk | 10-30 minutes |
| -25 to -45°F | Very high risk | 5-10 minutes |
| Below -45°F | Extreme danger | Less than 5 minutes |

### Cold-Related Illnesses

**Frostbite**
- Symptoms: Numbness, white or grayish-yellow skin, hard or waxy-feeling skin
- Most common on: Fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks, chin
- Action: Get into warm room. Do NOT rub affected area. Immerse in warm (not hot) water. Do not walk on frostbitten feet if possible.

**Hypothermia (Medical Emergency)**
- Symptoms: Shivering, exhaustion, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech, drowsiness
- Action: Call 911. Move to warm room. Remove wet clothing. Warm center of body first (chest, neck, head, groin). Warm beverages can help if conscious. Keep person dry and wrapped in warm blankets.

### Cold Safety Tips

- Dress in layers: inner wicking layer, insulating middle layer, outer wind/water barrier
- Cover extremities: hat, gloves, scarf covering mouth
- Stay dry - wet clothing loses insulation
- Keep moving to generate body heat
- Eat well - your body needs fuel to generate heat
- Limit time outdoors in extreme cold
- Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia
- Keep emergency supplies in vehicles: blankets, food, water, flashlight
- Let someone know your travel plans

### Special Considerations

**Elderly**: Less able to regulate body temperature, may not feel cold as intensely
**Infants**: Lose body heat faster than adults, can't shiver effectively
**Outdoor workers**: Take regular breaks in warm areas
**Homeless**: Know local warming shelter locations to share
