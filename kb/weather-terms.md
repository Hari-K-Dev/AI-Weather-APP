# Weather Terms Glossary

## Temperature Terms

**Feels Like Temperature (Apparent Temperature)**: The temperature equivalent perceived by humans, taking into account wind chill and humidity. On hot days, high humidity makes it feel hotter; on cold days, wind makes it feel colder.

**Dew Point**: The temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture and dew forms. A dew point above 65°F (18°C) feels humid and uncomfortable. Below 55°F (13°C) feels pleasant.

**Heat Index**: A measure of how hot it feels when humidity is factored in with actual air temperature. Used primarily in summer.

**Wind Chill**: How cold it feels when wind is factored in with actual air temperature. Wind removes heat from exposed skin faster than still air.

## Precipitation Terms

**Precipitation Probability**: The chance that precipitation will occur at any given point in the forecast area. A 40% chance means 4 out of 10 similar weather patterns produce rain.

**Accumulation**: The total amount of snow, rain, or ice expected to fall, measured in inches or millimeters.

**Drizzle**: Light precipitation with droplets less than 0.5mm in diameter. Usually falls from stratus clouds.

**Freezing Rain**: Rain that freezes on contact with surfaces that are at or below freezing temperature, creating ice.

**Sleet**: Ice pellets formed when rain freezes before hitting the ground.

## Atmospheric Terms

**Barometric Pressure**: The weight of the atmosphere above us, measured in inches of mercury (inHg) or millibars (mb). Rising pressure typically indicates improving weather; falling pressure suggests deteriorating conditions.

**Humidity**: The amount of water vapor in the air. Relative humidity is the percentage of moisture in the air compared to what it could hold at that temperature.

**Visibility**: The distance at which objects can be clearly seen, affected by fog, rain, snow, dust, or haze.

## Wind Terms

**Gust**: A sudden, brief increase in wind speed. Gusts typically last less than 20 seconds.

**Sustained Wind**: The average wind speed over a two-minute period.

**Wind Direction**: The direction from which the wind is blowing. A "north wind" blows from north to south.

## Cloud Terms

**Overcast**: Sky completely covered by clouds (100% cloud cover).

**Partly Cloudy**: 30-70% of the sky covered by clouds.

**Mostly Cloudy**: 70-90% of the sky covered by clouds.

**Clear**: Less than 10% cloud cover.
