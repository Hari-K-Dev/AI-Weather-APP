# UV Index and Air Quality Basics

## UV Index

The UV Index measures the strength of sunburn-producing ultraviolet radiation at a particular place and time.

### UV Index Scale

| Index | Level | Description | Protection Needed |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0-2 | Low | Minimal danger | Sunglasses on bright days |
| 3-5 | Moderate | Moderate risk | Sunscreen SPF 30+, hat |
| 6-7 | High | High risk | Sunscreen, hat, seek shade |
| 8-10 | Very High | Very high risk | Avoid midday sun, full protection |
| 11+ | Extreme | Extreme risk | Stay indoors if possible |

### UV Protection Tips

- **Peak UV hours**: 10 AM to 4 PM
- **SPF meaning**: SPF 30 blocks 97% of UVB rays; SPF 50 blocks 98%
- **Reapply sunscreen**: Every 2 hours, or after swimming/sweating
- **Shadow rule**: If your shadow is shorter than you, UV is high
- **Reflection**: Water, sand, and snow reflect UV rays, increasing exposure
- **Clouds**: Up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds

## Air Quality Index (AQI)

The AQI is a standardized indicator of air quality that tells you how clean or polluted the air is and what health effects might be of concern.

### AQI Categories

| AQI | Category | Health Implications |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| 0-50 | Good | Air quality is satisfactory |
| 51-100 | Moderate | Acceptable; sensitive groups may experience effects |
| 101-150 | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | Sensitive groups should limit outdoor exertion |
| 151-200 | Unhealthy | Everyone may experience health effects |
| 201-300 | Very Unhealthy | Health alert; everyone at risk |
| 301-500 | Hazardous | Emergency conditions |

### Common Pollutants

**PM2.5**: Fine particles 2.5 micrometers or smaller. Can penetrate deep into lungs and bloodstream. Sources: wildfires, vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions.

**PM10**: Particles 10 micrometers or smaller. Can irritate eyes, nose, and throat. Sources: dust, pollen, mold.

**Ozone (O3)**: Ground-level ozone formed by sunlight reacting with pollutants. Worse on hot, sunny days. Can trigger asthma and reduce lung function.

**NO2**: Nitrogen dioxide from vehicle exhaust and power plants. Irritates airways and increases susceptibility to respiratory infections.

**CO**: Carbon monoxide from incomplete combustion. Reduces oxygen delivery to organs.

### Protecting Yourself from Poor Air Quality

- Check AQI before outdoor activities
- Sensitive groups: children, elderly, people with respiratory/heart conditions
- Reduce outdoor exertion when AQI is high
- Keep windows closed on high pollution days
- Use air purifiers with HEPA filters indoors
- Wear N95 masks when AQI exceeds 150
