# Thunderstorm Safety Guide

## Understanding Thunderstorms

Thunderstorms form when warm, moist air rises rapidly into the atmosphere. They can produce dangerous lightning, heavy rain, hail, strong winds, and tornadoes.

### Thunderstorm Warning Signs

- Large, dark cumulonimbus clouds
- Distant rumbling thunder
- Sudden temperature drop
- Increasing wind
- Darkening sky
- Lightning flashes

## Lightning Safety

Lightning is the most dangerous aspect of thunderstorms. It can strike up to 10 miles from rainfall.

### The 30-30 Rule

1. If thunder follows lightning by 30 seconds or less, seek shelter
2. Wait 30 minutes after the last thunder before resuming outdoor activities

### Indoor Safety

- Stay away from windows, doors, and concrete walls
- Avoid using corded phones (cell phones are safe)
- Don't touch plumbing - avoid showers, baths, washing dishes
- Unplug sensitive electronics
- Stay off porches and out of garages

### Outdoor Safety

**If caught outside with no shelter:**
- Never shelter under isolated trees
- Avoid open fields, hilltops, and ridges
- Stay away from water, metal fences, and power lines
- Crouch low with feet together, minimizing ground contact
- If in a group, spread out 50-100 feet apart

**Safe shelters:**
- Substantial buildings (not sheds, picnic shelters, or tents)
- Hard-topped vehicles with windows closed
- Enclosed shopping centers

### If Someone Is Struck by Lightning

- Call 911 immediately
- It's safe to touch a lightning strike victim
- Begin CPR if they're not breathing
- Move victim to safety only if lightning threat continues
- Treat for shock: keep warm, elevate legs

## Severe Thunderstorm Components

### Heavy Rain and Flash Floods

- Turn around, don't drown - never drive through flooded roads
- 6 inches of water can knock you down
- 12 inches can float a vehicle
- Move to higher ground during flash flood warnings

### Hail

- Seek sturdy shelter immediately
- If driving, pull over away from trees
- Cover your head if caught outside
- Large hail can break windows and cause injury

### Damaging Winds

- Winds can exceed 60 mph without being a tornado
- Secure loose outdoor items before storms
- Stay away from windows during high winds
- If driving, pull over away from trees and power lines

### Tornadoes

- Tornado Watch: conditions favor tornado development
- Tornado Warning: tornado detected or imminent
- Seek shelter in interior room on lowest floor
- Get under sturdy furniture
- Mobile homes are not safe - evacuate to sturdy building
