# Wind and Rain Activity Planning Guide

## Understanding Wind Speeds

### Beaufort Wind Scale (Simplified)

| Speed | Description | Outdoor Impact |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 0-3 mph | Calm | Perfect for all activities |
| 4-7 mph | Light | Ideal conditions |
| 8-12 mph | Gentle | Good for most activities |
| 13-18 mph | Moderate | Cycling harder, small craft advisory |
| 19-24 mph | Fresh | Difficult cycling, umbrellas hard to use |
| 25-31 mph | Strong | Walking difficult, outdoor dining unpleasant |
| 32-38 mph | Near Gale | Walking dangerous, secure loose objects |
| 39+ mph | Gale+ | Stay indoors, structural damage possible |

### Activity-Specific Wind Guidelines

**Running/Jogging**
- Ideal: Under 15 mph
- Manageable: 15-20 mph (plan routes with wind at back on return)
- Avoid: Over 25 mph

**Cycling**
- Ideal: Under 10 mph
- Manageable: 10-20 mph (expect 20-50% more effort into wind)
- Dangerous: Over 25 mph (stability compromised)

**Golf**
- Ideal: Under 10 mph
- Playable: 10-20 mph (adjust club selection)
- Challenging: 20-30 mph
- Cancel: Over 30 mph

**Fishing**
- Ideal: 5-10 mph (creates ripples, fish feed more)
- Manageable: 10-20 mph
- Difficult: Over 20 mph (waves, casting issues)

**Boating**
- Small boats (<20ft): Under 15 mph
- Medium boats: Under 25 mph
- Know your boat's limits

**Outdoor Events**
- Tents/canopies: Secure at 15+ mph, remove at 25+ mph
- Paper goods become problematic: 10+ mph

## Understanding Precipitation

### Rain Intensity

| Rate | Description | Visibility | Impact |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|
| <0.1 in/hr | Light | Good | Minimal inconvenience |
| 0.1-0.3 in/hr | Moderate | Reduced | Umbrella recommended |
| 0.3-0.5 in/hr | Heavy | Poor | Outdoor activities difficult |
| >0.5 in/hr | Very Heavy | Very Poor | Flash flood risk, stay indoors |

### Activity Planning by Precipitation Chance

| Probability | What It Means | Planning Advice |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0-20% | Unlikely | Proceed as normal |
| 20-40% | Slight chance | Have backup plan |
| 40-60% | Scattered | Expect some rain |
| 60-80% | Likely | Plan for rain |
| 80-100% | Almost certain | Reschedule or indoor alternative |

### Outdoor Activity Recommendations

**Hiking**
- Light rain: Waterproof jacket, avoid exposed ridges
- Moderate rain: Consider shorter trails, watch for slippery surfaces
- Heavy rain: Postpone - flash flood risk in valleys, poor visibility

**Camping**
- <30% rain chance: Normal preparations
- 30-60%: Extra tarps, waterproof gear bags
- >60%: Consider canceling or finding covered camping

**Outdoor Sports**
- Soccer/Football: Playable in light rain, dangerous on lightning
- Tennis: Courts unplayable when wet
- Baseball: Usually canceled in steady rain
- Swimming: Outdoor pools close for lightning, not rain

**Photography**
- Overcast: Excellent for portraits (soft light)
- Light rain: Dramatic shots, protect equipment
- Golden hour after rain: Best natural lighting

## Combined Conditions Planning

### Wind + Rain Together

Wind and rain combined increase discomfort and danger exponentially.

| Wind | Light Rain | Moderate Rain | Heavy Rain |
|------|------------|---------------|------------|
| Light | Mild | Unpleasant | Indoor |
| Moderate | Unpleasant | Challenging | Dangerous |
| Strong | Challenging | Dangerous | Stay Inside |

### General Planning Tips

1. **Check forecasts 24 hours ahead** for outdoor events
2. **Have backup plans** for 40%+ precipitation chance
3. **Morning activities** often have calmer winds than afternoon
4. **Pack layers** - conditions can change rapidly
5. **Know your limits** - conditions feel worse than measurements suggest when combined
6. **Protect electronics** - rain and wind can damage phones/cameras quickly
